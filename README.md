# Outline

This is a repository for the assignments of the [IE675b Machine Learning](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/teaching/course-details/courses-for-master-candidates/ie-675b-machine-learning/) course at the University of Mannheim.

The assignments focus on core machine learning concepts, algorithms, and their implementation in Python, with a strong emphasis on model training, evaluation, and analysis. Each assignment is organized into its own directory, containing code, reports, and visualizations to aid in understanding the various techniques and models applied.

## Assignments Overview

### 1st Assignment: Naive Bayes
In this assignment, we implemented a Naive Bayes classifier with a focus on classification using the MNIST dataset. Key components include:
- Training the Naive Bayes model using a Dirichlet prior with MAP estimation.
- Evaluating the model's accuracy and analyzing performance using a confusion matrix.
- Conducting experiments with model selection, data generation, and handling missing data.
  
For more details, see the full [README for Assignment 1](./Assignment%201/README.md).

### 2nd Assignment: Logistic Regression
This assignment involves logistic regression, using both MLE and MAP estimation techniques on the Spambase dataset. The main highlights include:
- Training logistic regression models with different regularization settings.
- Exploring the effects of regularization on feature importance and model interpretability.
- Comparing gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent approaches for optimization.

For more details, see the full [README for Assignment 2](./Assignment%202/README.md).
